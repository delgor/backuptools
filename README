== Overview ==
These are just some little scripts I use for backing up stuff. Feel free to modify them according to your needs. Used software: duplicity, rsync

== Files ==
* .backup.conf: General configuration - this one has to be in your home directory.
* backup_databases.sh: Generate Database Backups - copied almost verbatim from http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/MySQL/Backup
* backup_files.sh: Generates full/incremental backups using duplicity, symmetrically encrypted by GnuPG using the given passphrase.
* transfer.sh: Simple rsync wrapper used to copy the generated backup to another directory. 
* upload.sh: Uses transfer.sh to really get the backup somewhere. In my case, thats mounting a remote fs, transfer.sh, unmounting.
* backup_complete.sh: Do everything at once. Generates the database and file backup, then uploads them.
* files.list: List of files to include/exclude in the backup. See the duplicity man page for details.
* mysql.conf: Login data for the mysqld. Needs global SELECT access, SHOW DATABASES and probably LOCK TABLES permissions.

.backup.conf belongs in your home directory, everything else goes into the path specified by BACKUP_BASEDIR in .backup.conf. Backups are stored in the path specified by BACKUP_TARGET.

== Known Issues ==
* Database backups are currently MySQL-only, settings are hardcoded.
* There is no option for disabling the database backup in backup_complete.sh.
* There is no option to automatically generate new full backups (instead of incremental ones) every X days.
